# EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems

## Course Overview
EE319K will continue the bottom-up educational approach, started in BME303 and EE306. The overall educational objective is to allow students to discover how the computer interacts with its environment. It will provide hands-on experiences of how an embedded system could be used to solve EE problems. The focus will be understanding and analysis rather than design. The analog to digital converter (ADC) and digital to analog converter (DAC) are the chosen mechanism to bridge the CE and EE worlds. EE concepts include Ohms Law, LED voltage/current, resistance measurement, and stepper motor control. CE concepts include I/O device drivers, debugging, stacks, FIFO queues, local variables and interrupts.

I think they work, but history has shown, sometimes I can be wrong.

## Labs
##### To configure your workspace for the labs:

1. Install [Keil] (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/KeilInstall.htm)
2. Install drivers for [Windows XP] (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/edX/InstallDriversXP.htm), [Windows Vista] (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/edX/InstallDriversVista.htm), [Windows 7] (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/edX/InstallDrivers7.htm), and [Windows 8] (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/edX/InstallDrivers8.htm).
3. Install [EE319kWare] (http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/EE319K_InstallSpring2016.exe)

##### The starter files for each lab are hosted in a separate repository. Links to the lab repositories can be found here:
